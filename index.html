      <h1>3 wave crash</h1>
      <p>
        In most cases you'll want to 3 wave crash. 
        Since the TP changes, you should 90% of the time be taking TP.
        (I will go over when to actually go TP later on).
        Stack Q level 1. [Q when the ARRIVE to lane]. Then try to gain and advantage.
        Crashing 2 wave with minion match is still favored towards you.
