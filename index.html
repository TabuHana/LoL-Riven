      <h1>3 wave crash</h1>
      <p>
        In most cases you'll want to 3 wave crash. 
        Since the TP changes, you should take ignite 90% of the time instead of taking TP.
        (I will go over when to actually go TP later on).
        Stack Q level 1. [Q when the ARRIVE to lane]. Then try to gain and advantage.
        Crashing 2 wave with minion match is still favored towards you.

    <h1>Tempo Reset</h1>
    <p>
      This is more or less a follow up to a 3 wave crash. Although there are other cases when you can have a "tempo reset", it is mainly most useful for riven early, then the rest is mainly used in top lane fundamentals.
      You mainly have 2 angles you can use for an early reset.
